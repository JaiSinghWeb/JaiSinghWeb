## Hi there , I'm Jai! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
Hello! My name is Jaivardhan Singh and I enjoy creating things. My interest in web development started back in 2020 when I decided to try editing text on various Web Pages â€” turns out editing elements on various websites taught me a lot about HTML & CSS ! 

Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of educating myself about Web Development through various courses and the Internet . My main focus these days is building accessible websites and exapanding my knowledge.
